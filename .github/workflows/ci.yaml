# GitHub CI Workflow for Daydream Travel System
#
# This workflow handles the continuous integration pipeline for the Daydream Travel System,
# performing unit tests and simulating deployment to a test environment.
#
# Triggers:
# - When code is pushed to the main branch
# - When a pull request is created targeting the main branch
#
# Jobs:
# 1. unit-tests:
#    - Runs on Ubuntu latest
#    - Checks out the code
#    - Sets up Python 3.9
#    - Installs required dependencies
#    - Executes unit tests and generates JUnit XML report
#    - Uploads test results as an artifact
#
# 2. deploy:
#    - Runs on Ubuntu latest
#    - Depends on successful completion of unit-tests
#    - Simulates deployment to a test environment
#    - Currently contains a placeholder for the actual deployment command
#
# Note: The deployment step is currently a simulation. Replace the echo commands
# with actual deployment instructions when moving to production.
